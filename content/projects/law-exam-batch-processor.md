# Law Exam Batch Processor

Enterprise‑grade, self‑hosted system for generating **strict, exam‑oriented Indian law answers**, performing **domain‑prioritized fact‑checking**, and exporting **verified PDFs**.

***

## 1. Overview

**Law Exam Batch Processor** is a production‑ready Flask application designed for Indian law students, researchers, and legal professionals who require:

* Strict, marks‑oriented exam answers
* Minimal but authoritative case‑law usage
* Statute‑first accuracy with verification
* Batch processing of questions
* Single consolidated, printable PDF output

The system combines:

* Local LLM inference (Ollama)
* Self‑hosted metasearch (SearXNG)
* Deterministic prompt control
* Pandoc + wkhtmltopdf publishing

***

## 2. Architecture

### Backend

* **Flask** – REST API and task orchestration
* **Threaded workers** – Non‑blocking batch execution
* **Ollama** – Local LLM inference (Gemma 3 4B)
* **SearXNG** – Fact‑checking via Indian legal domains
* **Pandoc + wkhtmltopdf** – Markdown → PDF pipeline

### Frontend

* Pure HTML + CSS + JavaScript (no framework)
* Dark, distraction‑free exam interface
* Live progress polling
* Incremental answer rendering
* One‑click final PDF export

***

## 3. Key Features

* Strict exam‑safe answer format
* One‑case‑law rule enforced
* Statute‑priority verification
* Domain‑weighted search ranking
* Per‑question Markdown archival
* Final combined verified PDF
* Self‑hosted, offline‑friendly
* No third‑party APIs or data leakage

***

## 4. Answer Policy (Exam Mode)

Each answer strictly follows:

1. Meaning / Direct Answer
2. Statutory Provision
3. Essential Points (brief explanation only)
4. Case Law (ONE most relevant case)
5. Conclusion
6. Confidence Level

**Explicitly excluded**:

* Academic discussion
* Multiple case laws
* Illustrations
* Comparative commentary

***

## 5. Fact‑Checking Strategy

* Queries routed through self‑hosted SearXNG
* Domain‑priority scoring
* Preferred sources:

  * indiankanoon.org
  * sci.gov.in
  * supremecourtofindia.nic.in
  * highcourts.gov.in
  * gov.in
* LLM instructed to:

  * Correct errors only
  * Preserve structure
  * Avoid expansion
